  /*
   Write a Java program that reads an integer between 0 and 1000 and adds all the digits in the integer.
An integer is a number that can be written without a fractional component. For example, 23, 6, 0, and âˆ’1245 are integers.
Input Data
Input an integer between 0 and 1000: 565
Expected Output :
The sum of all digits in 565 is 16
